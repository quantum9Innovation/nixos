![A dependency graph of my NixOS system](./frame.png)

*Above*: A dependency graph of my NixOS system, generated with [nix-visualize](https://github.com/craigmbooth/nix-visualize); note the almost horizontal line through the middle of the image (you can visibly *see* the feature bloat that comes with [QuasarOS](https://github.com/quantum9innovation/QuasarOS).

A random assortment of some of my [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) ([QuasarOS](https://github.com/quantum9innovation/QuasarOS)-based) configurations for testing/debugging/experimentation purposes;
this also happens to be the system that I daily drive.
You can find my system configuration, tailored for QuasarOS, [here](https://github.com/quantum9innovation/netsanet).
